Dillinger's Math Quiz Programs

These 4 simple applications are Math Table quiz programs.
I wrote these purely for my own purposes to help me isolate areas in math where I was slow.
The first phase runs you through the complete Math Tables, 100 questions in all. It will clock your reaction time on each answer. After you have completed the quiz, it will print out your times, and give you the option to go over the ones you are having trouble with. This allows you to focus more on problems that you need to work on. 
Your scores may surprise you. For instance I noted that I was slow on multiplying by 0 because every time I would see a problem like this: 5 * 0 =
I would say to myself "0 times any number always equals 0" mentally before writing the answer. That burns time. I had to unlearn that habit.

The programs are made as simple console apps for maximum timing efficiency, especially if run under a Windows free Operating System environment, such as a DOS only computer. You can get millisecond accuracy if you cut Windows out of the picture.

The folder contains both the running Windows Console Apps as well as the C# source files.
